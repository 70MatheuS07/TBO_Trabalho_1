# 🔍 Assignment 1 - Search and Sorting Techniques (TBO)

This repository contains Assignment 1 for the course **Search and Sorting Techniques (TBO)**, taken during the 1st semester of the **Computer Science** program at the **Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES)**.

## 📌 Description

The goal of this assignment is to implement and analyze classic search and sorting algorithms. The main objective is to deepen the understanding of how these techniques work and evaluate their efficiency through practical application.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Search algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search)
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort)
- Complexity analysis
- Comparative study between methods

## 📝 Notes

This assignment was developed as part of the course evaluation, under the guidance of [Professor's Name, if you wish to include]. All algorithms were implemented from scratch without using external sorting or search libraries.
